# Wizertask
Developed using Java Spring boot and Thymeleaf/Bootstrap 5 for the frontend.
This project is about creating a books and category library. Users can create a new book and as well as a new category.
All books should have a particular category when adding to the library. 
Users can edit, delete books/category
Users can also add a selected book to the list of favourites.

Steps to install:
1. The application is using a mySQL database connection(I would have used H2 DB but I thought MySQL should be better)
2. Setup a mySQL connection on your machine and create a database called archive(don't bother creating any tables. The service will handle that upon startup)
3. Clone this repo to your machine and start the server. Server is running on port 8083
4. Landing page for the service is localhost:8083/web/home
5. Then you're good to go to perform all operations created on the application.

Have fun navigating!
